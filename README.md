## General Information
- A small demo app which was build during online course on Typescript.
- The app allows to manage lists of active and finished projects (you can add new projects, move     them betweeen lists as well as delete them). 
- Thanks to this project I've learned basics of Typesript and OOP.

## Technologies Used
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - a programming language developed by Microsoft that builds up on JavaScript
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - a module bundler which main purpose is to bundle JavaScript file for usage in a browser
